Title: Java on Sensors

Description (200 words): 

In the last two years we have seen a huge increase in the "buzz" around
the topic of Wireless Sensor Applications. Products such as Motes and
Embers have emerged, along with standards including IEEE 802.15.4 and
Zigbee.  We have seen reports of a few applications in journals and at
conferences, but on the whole the developer community has not moved
significantly to create applications for these new platforms.

The SunSpot project at Sun Labs was started to draw together several
threads of complementary research into a new advanced development
programme. The result of this program is a new system designed to allow
developers to rapidly create complete Wireless Sensor Applications using
Java. The system includes hardware--small battery powered sensor
devices; and software--a tiny reflective Java VM (the Squawk VM) and 
a development kit.  Squawk acts as the OS all the way down to the hardware, 
not just as a thin veneer over another system.

In this talk we will introduce the SunSpot technology and explain why
Java is a good fit for embedded systems.  We will also demonstrate
several applications built using the technology. 



Short description: 
This talk describes the use of the Squawk Java Virtual Machine on a 
small, wireless sensor platform called SunSpot.  This talk will describe 
the motivations for using a JVM on wireless sensor devices and the 
advantages of using the Squawk VM.  Demonstrations of working systems 
running on the hardware will also be shown.
