</b></font></font>
<p>The main goal of the Squawk virtual machine project is to write as much of 
the virtual machine as possible in Java, for portability, ease of
debugging, and maintainability (inspired by the Smalltalk <a
 href="http://www.squeak.org">Squeak</a> project).&nbsp; Traditionally, most
JVMs are written in C/C++.&nbsp; Squawk aims at pushing the bar and writing
most of the JVM in Java.

<p>
Squawk is fully Java compliant and 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/cldc/">CLDC</a> 1.1-compatible (i.e., it's Java ME).&nbsp;

<h2><a name="architecture">The Squawk Architecture</a></h2>
<p>The current architecture of the Squawk VM was inspired in part by 
the Klein VM architecture. In particular, it is (mostly) implemented in the language that
it executes (Java); its components include: 
 
<ul>
    <li>The class loader/bytecode translator</li>
    <li>The ahead-of-time bytecode optimizer</li>
    <li>The threading system (green threads)</li>
    <li>The garbage collectors (selected at build time):
        <ul>
            <li>Simple two space Cheney collector</li>
            <li>Mark/compact "Lisp2" collector</li>
            <li>Generational mark/compact "Lisp2" collector</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

Squawk's design includes a compiler that can be used to:

<ul>
  <li>compile the core VM components ahead-of-time</li>
  <li>compile an interpreter written in Java ahead-of-time</li>
  <li>compile other Java components ahead-of-time</li>
  <li>compile bytecodes just-in-time (JIT compilation)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other features of the Squawk architecture include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
<p><b>A compact bytecode instruction set</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Smaller than standard bytecode (35% - 45% size of equivalent J2ME class files)</li>
  <li>Fixed up/pre linked</li>
  <li>Immutable ==&gt; execute in place</li>
  <li>Simplified garbage collection:
      <ul>
          <li>local variables are partitioned into pointers and primitives ==&gt; only one pointer map per method</li>
          <li>there is nothing on evaluation stack at operations that may result in an invocation ==&gt; no need to statically interpret methods during GC </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><b>Suites</b></p>

<p>A suite is a collection of classes. Each class in a suite only refers to other
classes in the suite or to a class in a parent suite. That is, a chain of suites
is a transitive closure of classes as shown below:

<p><img border="0" src="../figures/SuiteChain.jpg" alt="Chain of suites" width="594" height="314"></p>

The representation of classes in a suite is very compact
as they are all prelinked to each other.  On average, suites are 
one third of the size of class files.</p>  

<p>Once a suite is <i>closed</i> (i.e. cannot
have any more classes loaded into it), it is immutable.
An immutable suite can  be saved to and loaded from a file. This results in a
significantly reduced start up time when running an application from a suite
(as opposed to a dynamically loaded set of classes).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Isolates</b></p>

<p>An <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=121">isolate</a> 
is a mechanism by which an application is represented as an object. 
In Squawk, one or more applications can run in the single JVM. 
Conceptually, each application is completely isolated from all other applications. Given the
immutability of suites, the isolate implementation in Squawk shares common suites between
applications. This can significantly reduce the memory footprint of each application, which
is particularly important in the embedded device space.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard semantics of isolates, the Squawk implementation has
one extra feature: <i>isolate migration</i>. That is, an isolate running on one Squawk VM instance
can be paused, serialized to a file or over a network connection and restarted in another
Squawk VM instance. This feature is a direct result of certain architectural choices made
in Squawk such as using a green threaded model, representing all VM structures (including
thread stacks) as objects and not implementing a general native code interface such as the JNI.
The isolate migration mechanism also works between two VM instances running on platforms that
have a different machine word endianess. A compelling use of this mechanism is for deploying
a configured running application to a device running a Squawk VM that does not have the
resources required for standard class file loading and Java object serialization.</p>
