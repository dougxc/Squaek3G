<h1>Squawk for Java Card 3.0</h1>
<h2>(2002-2003)</h2>
<p>The primary goal of the Squawk for Java Card 3.0 project was to
build a very small footprint
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/cldc/">CLDC</a>-compatible
Java virtual machine.&nbsp;
A secondary goal was to write as much of the system as possible in
Java.
</p>
<p>The next generation Java Card platform, 3.0, will use 32-bit
microprocessors,
but will have very limited memory,
potentially no more than
8 kB of RAM,
32 kB of non-volatile memory, and
160 kB of ROM.
The major challenge of the project was thus to get complete
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/cldc/faqs.html">KVM</a>
functionality in such constrained space.<br>
</p>
<p>The Squawk for Java Card 3.0 implementation makes use of a split VM
architecture: an off-device translator which pre-verifies classfiles
and translates them into spaced-optimized collections of classes called
suites, and the on-device VM that interprets the suites.&nbsp; Suites
average about 35% the size of J2ME classfiles.&nbsp; The whole VM is
written in Java and tested under the Hotspot VM.&nbsp; For deployment
purposes, the VM code is translated into C code and compiled using an
optimizing C compiler.<br>
</p>
<p>The static footprint of the core system (interpreter, a RAM garbage
collector, an non-volatile memory garbage collector), compiled from C,
is 25 kB on x86.&nbsp; The minimum runtime footprint in RAM is 520
bytes for the Java heap and 532 bytes for native stack and data (on
x86).&nbsp; The runtime performance of Squawk is close to that of the
KVM. <br>
</p>
<p>The Squawk for Java Card 3.0 was considered by the
<a href="http://www.javacardforum.org/">Java Card Forum</a>
as one of the candidate for standardization
as the next generation Java Card runtime technology.
