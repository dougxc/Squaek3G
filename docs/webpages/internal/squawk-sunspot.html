</h1>
<h2>2004-present</h2>
<p>
The aim of the Squawk for Sun SPOT project is to deploy the 
<a href="squawk-rjvm.html">Squawk Java Virtual Machine</a> on the wireless 
sensor and actuator  
<a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com">Sun SPOT</a> 
device developed at Sun Labs.&nbsp; 
In this version of the Squawk JVM, the VM 
runs on the bare ARM-9 hardware and provides low-level operating 
system support, as well as application isolation (isolates).

The original port of Squawk to the ARM simulator was done by John Nolan in
October 2004.&nbsp; The port to run on the Atmel evaluation board and
the Sun SPOT device was initially done by John Nolan, John Daniels, and 
Dave Cleal.

<h2>The Squawk Split VM Architecture</h2>
</a>
<p>The Squawk for Sun SPOT VM is an interpretive JVM written mainly in 
the Java language.&nbsp; All of its components; the class loader, the verifier,
the transformer, the interpreter, the garbage collector, and the thread
scheduler, are written in the Java language.&nbsp; For performance reasons, the
interpreter
is written in the C language, and then compiled
by an
optimizing C compiler.&nbsp; The garbage collector used by the Squawk
VM is automatically translated from Java to C, for performance reasons.

<p><a name="arch">The
Squawk for Sun SPOT VM uses a split VM architecture in order to save memory 
on-device. 
Classes to be deployed onto the
device are verified and transformed into Squawk's internal object
representation, which is then saved onto a file called a <b>suite</b>.&nbsp;
Suites are then loaded into the sensors device and are interpreted by
the VM on-device.&nbsp; This allows for a smaller VM to be stored in the
sensor device, as well as faster start-up time for the sensor application (as
suites are resolved collections of Java classes).</a>
