</b></font></font>
<p>Squawk is a research virtual machine for the Java language that
examines better ways of building virtual machines.&nbsp; Most
commercial virtual machines are written in low level languages such as
C and assembler.&nbsp; We believe that virtual machines can be written
in higher level languages, such as those they execute themselves.
</p>
<p>The main goal of the Squawk project is to write as much of the
virtual machine as possible in Java, for portability, ease of
debugging, and maintainability.  Squawk was inspired by the <a
 href="http://www.squeak.org">Squeak</a> project.&nbsp;  Squawk aims at
a small footprint, it is Java compliant, and is
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/cldc/">CLDC 1.1</a>-compatible.&nbsp; 
Squawk is meant to be used in small, resource constraint devices.
</p>
<p>At present, there are two different deployments of the Squawk VM
to aim at different markets, namely, the very small footprint Java Card 
market and the wireless sensor and actuator device Sun(TM) SPOT:

  <li><a href="squawk-javacard.html">Squawk for Java Card 3.0</a> (2002-2003)</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall architecture and design decisions of the Squawk project are 
discussed in the <a href="squawk-rjvm.html">Squawk Virtual Machine</a> page.

Other research uses of Squawk include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../docs-internal/Squawk_for_Secure_Devices-2005.pdf">Squawk for 
    Secure Devices</a>, work by Andrew Crouch (intern winter 2004) under Bill
    Bush and Doug Simon's supervision, which describes the porting of the 
    <a href="http://sunlabs.eng/projects/svm/"> Secure KVM</a> 
    (SKVM) to Squawk.</li>
