  <h1 align="left">Squawk Inter-Isolate Communication</h1>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Squawk has a form of JSR-121 isolates, but no
  communication mechanism whereby data can be passed between them. This is a
  proposed message-passing system for inter-isolate communications that can also
  be used to communicate with very low-level interrupt handling software.</p>
  <h2>The Generic Connection Framework</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Squawk uses the CLDC generic connection framework for
  I/O. The proposed inter-isolate communication mechanism is built upon this
  using a new <i>StreamConnection</i> and <i>StreamConnectionNotifier</i>
  protocol called the “msg://” protocol.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The “msg://” protocol is strictly client-server, and
  has as its unit of communication the <i>message transaction</i>. All message
  transactions are divided into two parts, the client-to-server part and the
  server-to-client part. The sequence of communication is that the client
  transmits some data to the server, the server reads this, the server then
  transmits some reply to the client, and the client then receives this. These
  four operations constitute a message transaction. A transaction is only
  complete when all four phases are completed.</p>
  <h2>Transaction integrity</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Distributed systems commonly use some kind of two-phase
  commit protocol to ensure that transaction atomicity is achieved. The message
  protocol attempts to provide this kind of guarantee on a simple
  message-by-message basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  sender and receiver of a message should only commit the side effects of the
  message transaction when all the four phases are complete and no errors were
  detected. In the case where there is a network failure the sender and receiver
  should rollback to the state before the transaction was initiated.
  Unfortunately this can never be totally foolproof system because when the
  server sends the final reply to the client it is not be possible to report a
  logical transaction failure in the case then client crashes before its commit
  is performed. Similarly the client cannot be sure that the server has not
  crashed before its commit is complete. In database systems this problem is
  known as <i>In-Doubt Transactions</i>. Ultimately an agent that is a fixed
  point of contact must solve these problems. The agent can either be a human
  operator or a reliable computer system. It is not clear how this problem
  should be addressed in a distributed self-healing wireless network.</p>
  <h2>Addressing</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Messages are sent to logical rather than physical
  destinations. The system of mapping the logical address to a physical address
  is outside the scope of this design, but will typically range from a simple
  registry system for single node devices, to some kind of JINI-like discovery
  mechanism. The logical address is made up as follows:<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>msg://group/member/stream<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">where <i>group</i> is the name of a logical group of
  isolates, <i>member</i> is the name of an isolate in the group, and <i>stream</i>
  is the name of a stream within the isolate. Various defaults will exist to
  represent the group that the calling isolate is a member, or the subgroup that
  includes only the isolates in the same node as the caller.</p>
  <h2>Connection persistence</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal">All connections are infinitely persistent and optimistic.
  This means that if a client sends a message to a server connection that does
  not exist, the client will wait, potentially, forever, and so some kind of
  connection timeout may be required. There is no default timeout mechanism.
  Applications can manually kill connections after a time period, but unlike
  software that has to directly communicate with a human operator, sensor
  software will normally operate continuingly and the underlying communication
  system of the message passing protocol will deal with all low-level retry
  operations as necessary.</p>
  <h2>Client Example</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Following is an example of a client side connection. The
  server is the isolate called <i>sunstock </i>in the default group, and it is
  reading from a stream called <i>is64again</i>.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <pre>
  try {
    StreamConnection con = 
        (StreamConnection)Connectior.open(&quot;msg:///sunstock/is64again&quot;);
    InputStream  in  = con.openInputStream();
    OutputStream out = con.openOutputStream();

    // Write request to 'out'
    out.close();

    // Read reply from 'in' until EOF
    in.close();
    con.close();

    // Commit

  } catch (IOException ioe) {
    // Abort
  }
  </pre>
  <h2>Server Example</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Following is an example of a server side connection. This
  services the stream called <i>foo</i> in the current isolate.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <pre>
  try {
    StreamConnectionNotifier scn = 
        (StreamConnectionNotifier)Connectior.open(&quot;msg:////foo&quot;);
    for (;;) {
        try {
            StreamConnection con = scn.acceptAndOpen();
            InputStream  in  = con.openInputStream();
            OutputStream out = con.openOutputStream();

            // Read request from 'in' until EOF
            in.close();

            // Write reply to 'out'
            out.close();
            con.close();

            // Commit

        } catch (IOException ioe) {
            // Abort
        }
    }
  } catch (IOException ioe) {
    // Probable programming error
  }
  </pre>
  <h2>Drivers and Interrupts</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The inter-isolate message passing system is intended for
  communication between applications as well as communication between
  applications and device drivers.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Drivers commonly have at least two types of message. One
  is an I/O request from an application. The other is an interrupt from the
  hardware. It is rare to find a driver architecture where these two message
  types are the same, but this is the case in this system.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">One important observation is that the lifetimes of these
  message transactions are different. The I/O request message will typically
  start before and end after the interrupt message, and thus it is necessary for
  the driver to process at least two messages at one time.<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Courier"><O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Courier"><O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Courier"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>Lifetime of the I/O request message<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Courier">I-----------------------------------------------I<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Courier"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>I--------------I<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Courier"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>Lifetime of the interrupt message<O:P>
  </O:P>
  &nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Courier">Time ----&gt;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">This kind of problem is typically solved in Java by
  having two threads one for each message type in the following way. The I/O
  thread blocks waiting for an I/O request, and when one arrives it programs the
  hardware to do something and blocks. The interrupt waits for an interrupt
  message, and when one arrives it unblocks the first thread and dismisses the
  interrupt. The I/O request thread now sends the message reply information and
  loops around for the next request.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">There are a number of possible problems with this
  scenario in the Squawk system.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 39pt; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo4; tab-stops: list 39.0pt">1.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>There are at least two active threads, and, in general, this means that
  the need for some kind of thread scheduling which may not be very fast. It is
  sometimes necessary to respond to interrupts in a small number of cycles and
  the current Squawk thread scheduler will not do this.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 39pt; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo4; tab-stops: list 39.0pt">2.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>As there is more than one thread there are potential thread
  synchronization issues to be addressed.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">One attractive driver architecture is where all the code
  is implemented using exactly one thread. This enforces the serialization of
  all driver operations, which is often exactly the right model, and is
  certainly a simple one to program to.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">If the driver is run in an isolate that has a private
  memory space (i.e. not sharing a the heap with other isolates) then we can
  implement a two-level scheduling system where lower level scheduling is doing
  simple <i>isolate group</i> level context switching much like a operating
  system typically does process context switching, and then inside each isolate
  group the current Squawk scheduler operates. In the case of a driver it is in
  an isolate group that has only one isolate and this isolate has only one
  thread so no higher level scheduler is needed.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The solution to having one thread and several queues is
  to implement something like the Unix <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Courier">select()</span>
  function.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The following is the skeleton for a driver that supports
  three message queues. The first is a queue of I/O requests. The second is for
  interrupt notifications, and the third is for application status requests. All
  three are controlled with <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Courier; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">StreamConnectionNotifier</span>
  objects that are added into a <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Courier; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">StreamConnectionSelector</span>
  object for which a <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Courier; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">select()</span>function
  can be called to cause the calling thread to wait for the next available
  message.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The instance variable <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Courier; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">activeRequest</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">
  </span>is used to hold the active I/O request while the driver waits for the
  hardware to interrupt.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The interrupt message contains no useful data and just
  needs to be closed when the interrupt has been processed. Closing this
  connection causes low-level C code to be executed that will enable the device
  to generate further interrupts. This interlock ensures that interrupts cannot
  be generated when the interrupt message is being processed, which, in turn,
  means that a single statically allocated interrupt message connection object
  can be used for all interrupt messages.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p>The message protocol can be implemented to pre-allocate a
  <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Courier; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">StreamConnection
  </span>for each <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Courier; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">StreamConnectionNotifier
  </span>(if so desired). Doing this would lead to a driver that did not
  necessarily generate garbage when it operated, but would burden the programmer
  with a dangling pointer issue when the connection close operation allowed the
  object to be reused.</p>
