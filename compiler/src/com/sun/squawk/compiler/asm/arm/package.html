<body bgcolor="white">Implementation of an ARM machine code assembler used by the compiler for the Squawk Java virtual 
machine. 
<p>
The ARM assembler implementation is accessed through the <code>Assembler</code> class. The assembler
has methods representing most the ARM instruction set mnemonics and emits machine code. A number of 
support classes are used by the assembler:
<ul>
    <li>General purpose registers are abstracted by the <code>Register</code> class and the 
        <code>RegRange</code> class is used to specify individual or a sequential range of registers. 
    <li><code>Operand2</code> represents the flexible second operands for data processing and logic 
        instructions.
    <li><code>Address2</code> represents memory addresses for load and store word or unsigned byte 
        instructions.        
    <li><code>Address3</code> represents memory addresses for load and store (signed or unsigned)
        halfword, load signed byte, or load and store doubleword instructions.
	<li><code>Address4</code> represents memory addresses for load and store multiple instructions.
</ul>
