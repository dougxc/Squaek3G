<body bgcolor="white">Provides the compiler interfaces and classes for building a compilation system 
for the Squawk Java virtual machine. 
Implementations of this package can support multiple target architectures, such 
as IA32, ARM, PPC, etc.
<p>
The compiler framework (package) involves two entities: the <code>Compiler</code>
and the <code>Linker</code>.  The compiler provides the methods to compile an 
application to run on the Squawk JVM, be it a general-purpose Java application 
or the Squawk system classes themselves.  
The linker provides a way to link the object code produced by the compiler into 
a binary image that will run on the target architecture of choice (e.g., IA32, 
ARM, PPC).  
These two entities are controlled by the <code>Compilation</code> class. 
<p>
The <code>Compiler</code> interface supports the building of general-purpose 
applications, as well as the building of an interpreter by means of two 
interfaces: <code>BaseCompiler</code> (for general purpose applications), and 
<code>InterpCompiler</code> (for generation of the Squawk <code>Interpreter</code>).
<p> 
 

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The compiler package has been designed to be (source) language independent, as 
it does not support the semantics of the Java language or the Java bytecodes, or 
any other language for that matter.
Users of the compiler package rely on the elementary methods available in the 
<code>BaseCompiler</code> and the <code>InterpCompiler</code> interfaces, which 
are explained next. 


<h3>The <code>BaseCompiler</code> Interface</h3>

The <code>BaseCompiler</code> interface is a language-independent interface 
that supports the compilation of general purpose applications, whether those 
applications are written using the Java language or a language such as C.  
<p>
Therefore, the <code>BaseCompiler</code> interface provides methods to compile 
elementary pieces of information, such as arithmetic and logical operations 
(e.g., add, subtract, xor, shift left, etc.), transfer the flow of control 
operations (e.g., branch if greater than, call, return, etc.), function definition 
(e.g., begin, end), etc. 
Refer to the <a href="BaseCompiler.html">BaseCompiler Javadoc</a> for more 
information on the methods available in this interface. 


<h4>Example usage of the <code>BaseCompiler</code> interface</h4>

The following example illustrates the usage of the <code>BaseCompiler</code> 
interface.  
The core of the interface usage is between the <code>enter</code> and 
<code>compile</code> method invocations.
<p> 
We want to write an anonymous function that adds two integer numbers and 
returns the result of the addition.  
<p>
A function signature consists of it's start (denoted by <code>enter</code>) and 
end (denoted by <code>leave</code>), an optional name, it's formal parameters, 
and its return value type (if any). 
<p>
An <code>enter</code> method allows for a symbol name to be attached to the 
location of the entry to the function, hence, giving the function a name.  
An anonymous function is setup by not providing a symbol to the <code>enter</code>
method.
<p>
Parameters to a function are specified by the <code>parm</code> method, which
takes as argument the type of the formal parameter, and returns the location 
(a <code>Local</code>) for this parameter.  Users of the compiler interface 
can name formal parameters by assigning the returned location to a named variable. 
For example, in our example, we have setup two formal parameters: <code>x</code> 
and <code>y</code>, both of type integer.  
<p>
The return type of the function is specified by means of the <code>result</code>
method, which passes as actual parameter the type to be returned by the function. 
a return type of <code>VOID</code> means that no value gets returned.  

<pre>
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Compiler c = Compilation.newCompiler();

        c.enter();
        Local x = c.parm(INT);      // x
        Local y = c.parm(INT);      // y
        c.result(INT);
            c.begin();
                c.load(x);          // x
                c.load(y);          // y
                c.add();            // x + y
                c.ret();            // return
            c.end();
        c.leave();

        c.compile();
        Linker linker = Compilation.newLinker(c);
        int entry = linker.link();
        int res = CSystem.icall(new Parm(entry).parm(1).parm(2));

        System.out.println("1 + 2 = "+res);
        System.exit(0);
</pre>

A function's body is enclosed in a scope, denoted by <code>begin</code> and 
<code>end</code>.  
Within the function's scope, we can specify any set of instructions that will
build a function using a stack-based representation. 
In our example, we load the formal parameters <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> 
onto the stack, we add then by popping the top two elements of the stack, adding
them, and pushing the result of the addition back onto the stack, and we return
this result by emitting a return instruction (<code>ret</code>). 
<p>
In order to compile and execute this function, we make use of the 
<code>Compilation</code> class and the Squawk JVM <code>CSystem</code> support 
to run binary images. 
<p>
A new compiler <code>c</code> is instantiated by the <code>Compilation</code>'s
<code>newCompiler</code> method.  Code gets generated for this compiler, and 
once it is compiled, the <code>Compilation</code>'s <code>newLinker</code> 
method provides a linker, <code>linker</code>, to link in the results of the 
compilation and place the binary image in memory.  
The resulting start address of the compilation is returned by the <code>linker</code>. 
This address is then used by the <code>CSystem</code>'s <code>call</code> 
method to run the binary image with a given set of actual parameters.  


<h3>The <code>InterpCompiler</code> Interface</h3>

The <code>InterpCompiler</code> interface is a language-independent interface 
that extends the <code>BaseCompiler</code> interface to support the building 
of an interpreter (the <code>Interpreter</code>) in the Squawk JVM. 
<p>
The <code>InterpCompiler</code> interface makes use of the following pseudo 
types to aid in the construction of an interpreter: 
<ul>
<li> <code>MP</code>: the method pointer, a variable of this type points to the
     current method that is executing, 
<li> <code>IP</code>: the instruction pointer, a variable of this type points to 
     the next instruction to be executed, 
<li> <code>LP</code>: the local pointer, a variable of this type points to bottom 
     of the space occupied by locals in the stack frame, and 
<li> <code>SS</code>: the (compiler) stack pointer, a variable of this type points
     to the end of the stack frame allocated via an <code>alloca</code> instruction.  
</ul>
<p>
The interface provides for methods to access and grow the stack frame, to keep 
track of the value of the above pseudo-types, to create locals and parameters 
of the same, to store, and to write to them.  


<h4>Example usage of the <code>InterpCompiler</code> interface</h4>

The best way to illustrate how to use the <code>InterpCompiler</code> interface
is by means of an example.  
<p>
Interpreters are written using a loop over the instructions to be executed.
Assume you want to write an interpreter that can load values, store them, and 
subtract them, as well as know about constant values.  
These snippets of code can be written using standard <code>BaseCompiler</code> 
instructions, assuming the existance of a <code>gotonext</code> method, which 
gets the next instruction to be executed, and executes it.
For example, here is the code snippet to implement a subtract: 
<pre>
    c.bind(sub);
        c.pop(INT);
        c.pop(INT);
        c.swap().sub();
        c.push();
        gotonext();
</pre>
<p>
The <code>gotonext</code> method provides a way to get the instruction to be 
executed next and jump to its code snippet.  In the following sample code, the 
<code>getbyte</code> method gets the next byte to be executed in the program 
using the instruction pointer.  Given the byte of the program to be executed, 
a lookup into a <code>table</code> of labels for the code snippets can be done
to get the address of the code snippet and jump to that address: 
<pre>
    private void gotonext() {
        getbyte();
        c.literal(4);
        c.mul();
        c.literal(table);
        c.add();
        c.read(REF);
        c.jump();
    }
</pre>
<p>
The <code>getbyte</code> method is a standard method that returns/leaves on the
top of the stack, the next instruction (byte) to be executed, and increments the 
instruction pointer:
<pre>
    private void getbyte() {
        c.load(ip);
        c.dup();
        c.literal(1);
        c.add();
        c.store(ip);
        c.read(BYTE);
    }
</pre>
<p>
The most important part of the interpreter is the setting up of its 
<code>Local</code> variables <code>ip</code>, <code>mp</code>, <code>lp</code>, 
and <code>ss</code>.  
<p>
The method pointer (<code>mp</code>) gets set at instantiation time of a 
<code>Local</code> of type <code>MP</code>.  
Such method pointer can have one of three values: 
<ul>
<li> 0, if the special preamble for the method was <code>E_NULL</code>,
<li> a predefined register (<code>eax</code> for IA32), if the special 
     preamble for the method was <code>E_REGISTER</code>, or 
<li> the method's address, if the special preamble for the method was 
     <code>E_ADDRESS</code>.
</ul>
The method pointer points to the method that starts the execution of the 
program.  This method is set up by the Squawk JVM <code>dispatcher</code> (at 
present).
<p>
The instruction pointer (<code>ip</code>) is set to point to the bytes of the 
program to be executed.  In our example below, this is done by skipping over 
the bytes of the jump instruction that transfer control to the interpreter code 
itself, as the bytecodes to be executed were copied as data right after this 
instruction. 
<p>
The stack pointer (<code>ss</code>) is set by the <code>alloca</code> method, 
by storing the address of the end of the stack frame.
<p>
And the local pointer (<code>lp</code>) is set by storing the result of the 
<code>alloca</code> method (i.e., the address of the end of the stack frame).  
<p>
A complete sample program that implements an interpreter that knows about 
constants, loads, stores, and subtracts, follows.
<pre>
public class InterpreterExample implements Types {

    Compiler c = Compilation.newCompiler();

    Label sub   = c.label(); private byte SUB   = (byte)0;
    Label con   = c.label(); private byte CON   = (byte)1;
    Label load  = c.label(); private byte LOAD  = (byte)2;
    Label store = c.label(); private byte STORE = (byte)3;
    Label ret   = c.label(); private byte RET   = (byte)4;
    Label table = c.label();

    Local mp, ip, lp, ss;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new InterpreterExample().run();
    }

    public void run() {
        c.enter(Compiler.E_REGISTER);
        c.result(INT);
            c.begin();
                mp = c.local(MP);
                ip = c.local(IP);
                lp = c.local(LP);
                ss = c.local(SS);

                // set up the instruction pointer ip
                c.load(mp);
                c.literal(c.getJumpSize());
                c.add();
                c.store(ip);

                // check that there is still space in the (chunky) stack frame
                c.literal(WORD.getStructureSize() * 5);  // Number of extra local bytes
                c.literal(WORD.getStructureSize() * 5);  // Number of extra stack bytes
                c.stackCheck();

                // set up the stack pointer ss and the local pointer lp
                c.literal(WORD.getStructureSize() * 5);  // Allocate memory for 5 locals.
                c.alloca();
                c.store(lp);                             // Save address in lp

                gotonext();

            c.bind(sub);   // subtract code snippet
                c.comment("+++++++sub");
                c.pop(INT);
                c.pop(INT);
                c.swap().sub();
                c.push();
                gotonext();
                c.comment("-------sub");

            c.bind(con);   // constant code snippet
                c.comment("+++++++con");
                getbyte();
                c.push();
                gotonext();
                c.comment("-------con");

            c.bind(load);   // load code snippet

        c.comment("+getbyte");
        c.load(ip);

        c.literal(1);

        c.store(ip);
        c.read(BYTE);
        c.comment("-getbyte");
    }

    private void gotonext() {
        c.comment("+gotonext");
        getbyte();
        c.literal(4);
        c.mul();
        c.literal(table);
        c.add();
        c.read(REF);
        c.jump();
        c.comment("-gotonext");
    }
}
</pre>

Please note that the <code>InterpCompiler</code> interface is meant to be 
simplified in the near future.  This is to avoid the use of the pseudo-types 
and the complexity that such types create in the implementation of the 
interface.  
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
