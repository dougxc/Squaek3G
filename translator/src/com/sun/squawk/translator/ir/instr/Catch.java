     * for the Squawk bytecode verifier when stack items have been spilled
     * prior to code flow into the handler. To solve this IR for Catch is
     * set always to 'constrainsStack()' so that all stack input is always
     * spilled and then the code InstructionEmitter will output a CONST_NULL
     * instruction at the start of the handler and the address of the handler
     * in the exception table is incremented by one byte to avoid this
